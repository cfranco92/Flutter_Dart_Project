Starting to work with Flutter and the Dart programming language

# What is flutter?
Flutter is an SDK created by Google, designed to develop native applications (cross platform) for iOS and Android.

The main objective of Flutter is the design of mobile interfaces; However, it's based on a programming language that allows the sharing of source code for both platforms, which facilitates the use of business logic as a common element.

During 2017 Google made the presentation and launch of Flutter in its alpha version, then at the beginning of 2018 it launched the first beta version and by this time, in December 2018, the official version of Flutter 1.0 stable is available.

Flutter uses Dart, a programming language also created by Google and that would be oriented not only to the development of mobile applications but also of web applications, even Flutter is expected to be the main framework for the development of applications for Fuschia, the new OS in The one Google is working on.

Unlike the hybrid development of mobile applications based on a WebView to display HTML code, or the bridge development that uses intermediate renderers of native code for the generation of apps, Flutter compiles directly towards the final code that interacts with the processor, skipping the steps intermediate, so the resulting applications have better performance and higher performance. Flutter uses its own Widgets and rendering engine called Skia Canvas developed in C ++.

# Dart and Flutter 
Dart is the programming language that Flutter uses to operate. It is a programming language that uses the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. It has been created by Google and is considered by some as "the programming language of the future" for its versatility of use.

Dart can be used on mobile devices with Flutter; in web development, through a framework for frontend development with JavaScript called AngularDart, which is a combination with Angular; and it can even be used in backend development through frameworks for HTTP servers such as Aqueduct.

Even if no specific prior knowledge is needed to complete this course, having previously worked with Dart, with object-oriented programming languages ​​such as Java, C ++, etc. or having developed mobile applications using Android and iOS SDKs in native code, with React Native, Xamarin or Ionic, will make your way easier.

Dart's syntax looks a lot like Java. However, Google has stated that Dart is totally inspired by the reactive programming and programming style of React.js, so if you have previously worked with this framework (using styled components) it will be easy for you to understand and adopt the Dart syntax .
